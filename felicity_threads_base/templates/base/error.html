					Apology					
				</h2>
				<p>
				Hi,
				</p>

				<p>
				TLE is one of the most awaited contests of Threads, Felicity by IIIT Hyderabad.
				</p>

				<p>
				Unfortunately, because of errors from our side, the organizers, the contest didn't run as expected. One of the main reasons being that the participation outweighed our expectations. Also, we ran out of space on the server that was responsible for the contest. We are highly apologetic for not keeping the contest up to its expectations.
				</p>

				<p>
				We shall soon have a recontest and will definitely maintain the high standards we have met with the previous Threads contests.
				</p>

				<p>
				Again, we are really sorry for the short sight on our part with respect to the contest.
				</p>

				<p>
				Regards,
				</p>
				<p>
				Threads team, Felicity 2k15.
